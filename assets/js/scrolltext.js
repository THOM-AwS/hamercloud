        "I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the things I have to take Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on I have screamed until my veins collapsed I've waited as my time's elapsed Now, all I do is live with so much hate I've wished for this, I've bitched at that I've left behind this little fact You cannot kill what you did not create I've gotta say what I've gotta say And then, I swear, I'll go away But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise I guess I'll save the best for last My future seems like one big past You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache If the pain goes on I'm not gonna make it Put me back together Or separate the skin from bone Leave me all the pieces Then you can leave me alone Tell me the reality is better than the dream But I found out the hard way Nothing is what it seems I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the things I have to take Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it All I've got, all I've got is insane I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the things I have to take Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it All I've got, all I've got is insane",
        "Lashing out the action, returning the reaction Weak are ripped and torn away Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower Battery is here to stay Smashing through the boundaries Lunacy has found me Cannot stop the battery Pounding out aggression Turns into obsession Cannot kill the battery Cannot kill the family Battery is found in me Battery Battery Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers Never ending potency Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker Breeding on insanity Smashing through the boundaries Lunacy has found me Cannot stop the battery Pounding out aggression Turns into obsession Cannot kill the battery Cannot kill the family Battery is found in me Battery Battery Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing Powerhouse of energy Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry We create the battery Smashing through the boundaries Lunacy has found me Cannot stop the battery Pounding out aggression Turns into obsession Cannot kill the battery Cannot kill the family Battery is found in me Battery",
        "Don't be so hard on yourself Those tears are for someone else I hear your voice on the phone I hear you feel so alone My baby Oh my baby Please my baby My baby When we were young And truth was paramount We were older then, And we lived a life without any doubt Those memories, They seem so long ago What's become of them? (They've all gone for sure) When you feel like me I want you to know Don't cry Not alone Don't cry tonight, my baby Don't cry you'll always be loved Don't cry tonight my baby Today I dreamed Of friends I had before And I wonder why The ones who care don't call anymore My feelings hurt But you know I overcome the pain And I'm stronger now There can't be a fire unless there's a flame Don't cry Your not alone Don't cry tonight, my baby Don't cry you'll always be loved Don't cry oh Limousines and sycophants Don't leave me now, 'Cause I'm afraid what you've done to me Is now the wolf In my bed In my head In my head In my head The challenges, we took were hard enough They get harder now Even when we think that we've had enough Don't feel alone, 'Cause it's I you understand I'm your sedative, Take a piece of me whenever you can Don't cry you're not alone (don't be so hard on yourself) Don't cry tonight my baby (these tears are for someone else) Don't cry you'll always be loved (I hear your voice on the phone) Don't cry tonight sweet baby (I hear you fear so alone) Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't you cry, cry Don't cry 'cause you still be loved Don't cry Don't cry tonight, oh My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby My baby, my baby, my baby Don't cry tonight You'll still be loved",
        "You got a fast car I want a ticket to anywhere Maybe we make a deal Maybe together we can get somewhere Any place is better Starting from zero got nothing to lose Maybe we'll make something Me, myself, I got nothing to prove You got a fast car I got a plan to get us outta here I been working at the convenience store Managed to save just a little bit of money Won't have to drive too far Just 'cross the border and into the city You and I can both get jobs And finally see what it means to be living See, my old man's got a problem He live with the bottle, that's the way it is He says his body's too old for working His body's too young to look like his My mama went off and left him She wanted more from life than he could give I said somebody's got to take care of him So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast car Is it fast enough so we can fly away? We gotta make a decision Leave tonight or live and die this way So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I-I had a feeling that I belonged I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car We go cruising, entertain ourselves You still ain't got a job And I work in the market as a checkout girl I know things will get better You'll find work and I'll get promoted We'll move out of the shelter Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I-I had a feeling that I belonged I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car I got a job that pays all our bills You stay out drinking late at the bar See more of your friends than you do of your kids I'd always hoped for better Thought maybe together you and me'd find it I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere Take your fast car and keep on driving So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I-I had a feeling that I belonged I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car Is it fast enough so you can fly away? You gotta make a decision Leave tonight or live and die this way",
        "And with the early dawn Moving right along I couldn't buy an eye full of sleep And in the aching night under satellites I was not received Built with stolen parts A telephone in my heart Someone get me a priest To put my mind to bed This ringing in my head Is this a cure or is this a disease? Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show me how to live Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show me how to live And in the after birth On the quiet earth Let the stains remind you You thought you made a man You better think again Before my role defines you Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show me how to live Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show me how to live And in your waiting hands I will land, and roll out of my skin And in your final hours I will stand Ready to begin Ready to begin Ready to begin Ready to begin Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show me how to live Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show me how to live",
        "It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel And I didn't mind, it's not my kind It's not my time to wonder why Everything gone white, everything's grey Now you're here, now you're away I don't want this, remember that I'll never forget where you're at Don't let the days go by Glycerine, glycerine I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time Are you at one, or do you lie? We live in a wheel, where everyone steals But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste Don't let the days go by Could have been easier on you I couldn't change, though I wanted to Should have been easier by three Our old friend fear and you and me Glycerine, glycerine Don't let the days go by, glycerine Don't let the days go by Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah Glycerine, glycerine Oh, glycerine, glycerine Bad moon whine again Bad moon whine again As she falls around me I needed you more, we wanted us less Could not kiss, just regress It might just be me, simple, and plain Well that's just fine, that's just one of my names Don't let the days go by Could've been easier on you, you, you Glycerine, glycerine",
        "When you're talkin' to yourself And nobody's home You can fool yourself You came in this world alone Alone So, nobody ever told you, baby How it was gonna be What'll happen to you, baby Guess we'll have to wait and see One, two, three Old at heart, but I'm only 28 And I'm much too young to let love break my heart Young at heart, but it's getting much too late To find ourselves so far apart I don't know how you're supposed to find me lately And what more could you ask from me? How could you say that I never needed you When you took everything Said you took everything from me Young at heart, and it gets so hard to wait When no one I know can seem to help me now Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate If I'm to find my own way out Still talkin' to myself And nobody's home Alone So, nobody ever told us, baby How it was gonna be So, what'll happen to us, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see When I find out all the reasons Maybe I'll find another way Find another day With all the changing seasons of my life Maybe I'll get it right next time And now that you've been broken down Got your head out of the clouds You're back down on the ground And you don't talk so loud And you don't walk so proud Anymore, and what for? Well, I jumped into the river Too many times to make it home I'm out here on my own, and drifting all alone If it doesn't show, give it time To read between the lines 'Cause I see the storm is getting closer And the waves, they get so high Seems everything we've ever known's here Why must it drift away and die? I'll never find anyone to replace you Guess I'll have to make it through this time Oh, this time Without you I knew the storm was getting closer And all my friends said I was high But everything we've ever known's here I never wanted it to die"
