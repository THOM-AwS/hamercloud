crushing all that cower Battery is here to stay Smashing through the boundaries Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery Pounding out aggression Turns into obsession Cannot kill the battery Cannot
kill the family Battery is found in me Battery Battery Crushing all deceivers, mashing non - believers
Never ending potency Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker Breeding on insanity Smashing through
the boundaries Lunacy has found me Cannot stop the battery Pounding out aggression Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery Cannot kill the family Battery is found in me Battery Battery Circle of

    `I push my fingers into my eyes Its the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the
things I have to take Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on I have
screamed until my veins collapsed I've waited as my time's elapsed Now, all I do is live with so much hate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that I've left behind this little fact You cannot kill what you did
not create I've gotta say what I've gotta say And then, I swear, I'll go away But I can't promise you'll
enjoy the noise I guess I'll save the best for last My future seems like one big past You're left
with me 'cause you left me no choice I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops
the ache If the pain goes on I'm not gonna make it Put me back together Or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces Then you can leave me alone Tell me the reality is better than the dream But I
found out the hard way Nothing is what it seems I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that
slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the things I have to take Jesus, it never ends, it works it's
way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it All I've got, all I've got is insane I push my
fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the things I have
to take Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it All
I've got, all I've got is insane`,

become of them ? (They've all gone for sure) When you feel like me I want you to know Don't cry Not
alone Don't cry tonight, my baby Don't cry you'll always be loved Don't cry tonight my baby Today I
dreamed Of friends I had before And I wonder why The ones who care don't call anymore My feelings hurt But you

sycophants Don't leave me now, 'Cause I'm afraid what you've done to me Is now the wolf In my bed In my head In
my head In my head The challenges, we took were hard enough They get harder now Even when we think that
we've had enough Don't feel alone, 'Cause it's I you understand I'm your sedative, Take a piece of
me whenever you can Don't cry you're not alone(don't be so hard on yourself) Don't cry tonight my baby

    `You got a fast car I want a ticket to anywhere Maybe we make a deal Maybe together we can get
somewhere Any place is better Starting from zero got nothing to lose Maybe we'll make something Me, myself, I
got nothing to prove You got a fast car I got a plan to get us outta here I been working at the
convenience store Managed to save just a little bit of money Won't have to drive too far Just 'cross the border
and into the city You and I can both get jobs And finally see what it means to be living See, my old
man's got a problem He live with the bottle, that's the way it is He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his My mama went off and left him She wanted more from life than he
could give I said somebody's got to take care of him So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast
car Is it fast enough so we can fly away ? We gotta make a decision Leave tonight or live and die this
way So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk City
lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I-I had a feeling that I
belonged I - I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car We go
cruising, entertain ourselves You still ain't got a job And I work in the market as a checkout girl I know
things will get better You'll find work and I'll get promoted We'll move out of the shelter Buy a bigger
house and live in the suburbs So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car Speed so fast it
felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And
I - I had a feeling that I belonged I - I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a
fast car I got a job that pays all our bills You stay out drinking late at the bar See more of your
friends than you do of your kids I'd always hoped for better Thought maybe together you and me'd
find it I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere Take your fast car and keep on driving So I remember when we
were driving, driving in your car Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I-I had a feeling that I belonged I-I had a
feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car Is it fast enough so you can fly away ?
You gotta make a decision Leave tonight or live and die this way`,

    `And with the early dawn Moving right along I couldn't buy an eye full of sleep And in the aching
night under satellites I was not received Built with stolen parts A telephone in my heart Someone get me a
priest To put my mind to bed This ringing in my head Is this a cure or is this a disease ? Nail in my
hand From my creator You gave me life Now show me how to live Nail in my hand From my creator You
gave me life Now show me how to live And in the after birth On the quiet earth Let the stains remind you
You thought you made a man You better think again Before my role defines you Nail in my hand From my
creator You gave me life Now show me how to live Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show
me how to live And in your waiting hands I will land, and roll out of my skin And in your final hours I
will stand Ready to begin Ready to begin Ready to begin Ready to begin Nail in my hand From my
creator You gave me life Now show me how to live Nail in my hand From my creator You gave me life Now show
me how to live`,

    `It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel And I didn't mind,
it's not my kind It's not my time to wonder why Everything gone white, everything's grey Now you're here,
now you're away I don't want this, remember that I'll never forget where you're at Don't let the days go
by Glycerine, glycerine I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time Are you at one, or do you lie ? We live
in a wheel, where everyone steals But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields If I treated you bad,
you'd bruise my face Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste Don't let the days go by Could
have been easier on you I couldn't change, though I wanted to Should have been easier by three Our old
friend fear and you and me Glycerine, glycerine Don't let the days go by, glycerine Don't let the days go
by Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah Glycerine, glycerine Oh, glycerine, glycerine Bad moon whine
again Bad moon whine again As she falls around me I needed you more, we wanted us less Could not
kiss, just regress It might just be me, simple, and plain Well that's just fine, that's just one of my
names Don't let the days go by Could've been easier on you, you, you Glycerine, glycerine`,

    `When you're talkin' to yourself And nobody's home You can fool yourself You came in this world
alone Alone So, nobody ever told you, baby How it was gonna be What'll happen to you, baby Guess we'll
have to wait and see One, two, three Old at heart, but I'm only 28 And I'm much too young to let love break
my heart Young at heart, but it's getting much too late To find ourselves so far apart I don't know how
you're supposed to find me lately And what more could you ask from me? How could you say that I
never needed you When you took everything Said you took everything from me Young at heart, and it gets so
hard to wait When no one I know can seem to help me now Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate If I'm to
find my own way out Still talkin' to myself And nobody's home Alone So, nobody ever told us, baby How it
was gonna be So, what'll happen to us, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see When I find out all the
reasons Maybe I'll find another way Find another day With all the changing seasons of my life Maybe
I'll get it right next time And now that you've been broken down Got your head out of the clouds You're
back down on the ground And you don't talk so loud And you don't walk so proud Anymore, and what for?
Well, I jumped into the river Too many times to make it home I'm out here on my own, and drifting all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time To read between the lines 'Cause I see the storm is getting closer And
the waves, they get so high Seems everything we've ever known's here Why must it drift away and die ?
I'll never find anyone to replace you Guess I'll have to make it through this time Oh, this time Without
you I knew the storm was getting closer And all my friends said I was high But everything we've ever
known's here I never wanted it to die`,

    `Got off a plane to the countryside I drove to the mountain and holding the ground There was
crack on the corner and someone dead And fire coming out of the monkey's head Don't get
lost in heaven, eh They got locks on the gate, hey Don't go over the edge, eh You'll make
a big mistake, hey Put me in a cab to suburbia I just took a line but I wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home But you had left me, you don't know my
soul You're a whole bad mistake, yeah, you're a whole one Don't get lost in heaven, eh
They got locks on the gate, hey Don't go over the edge, eh You'll make a big mistake,

And I’ll drop the style clearly Know your enemy…Know your enemy! Yeah! Hey yo, and dick with this…uggh!
Word is born Fight the war, fuck the norm Now I got no patience So sick of complacence

Will it be dry tomorrow ? Time passes softly and I'm a day older But still I m living days gone by Ashes
to ashes, the rain's turning colder Finding tomorrow, the ashes, the rain and I`,

    `Life, it seems, will fade away Drifting further, every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly loss, this can't be real I cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness, taking dawn I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me Can save myself But it's too late Now I can't think Think why I should even try Yesterday seems as though
It never existed Death greets me warm Now I will just say goodbye Bye...`,

    `Have you got colour in your cheeks ? Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift The type that sticks
around like summat in your teeth ?
Are there some aces up your sleeve ? Have you no idea that you're in deep? I dreamt about you nearly every
night this week How many secrets
can you keep ? 'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep Spilling
drinks on my settee(Do I wanna know ?) If this feeling flows both ways ? (Sad to see you go) Was sort of
hoping that you'd stay (Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day Crawling back to you Ever
thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you So have you got the guts ?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts Simmer down and pucker
up I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm
constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you I don't know if you feel the same as I do But we could be
together if you wanted to(Do I wanna know ?)
If this feeling flows both ways ? (Sad to see you go) Was sort of hoping that you'd stay (Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day Crawling back to you (crawling back to you) Ever thought of calling
when you've had a few? (you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do) Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for
somebody new Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you(Do I wanna know ?) If this feeling flows both ways ? (Sad to see you go) Was sort of
hoping that you'd stay (Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day (Do I wanna know?) Too
busy being yours to fall(Sad to see you go)
