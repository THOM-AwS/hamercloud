				<h3><u>Project A:</u></h3> Using AWS Amplify, we made a Netflix style service to help the elderly to
				enjoy tailored content made just for them. Using an AWS template we created a service that could
				take
				uploads from a web portal that was protected by AWS Cognito, we can upload video content to an S3
				bucket
				for processing with the media encoder service. That encoded footage is put in a new bucket for
				consumption by cloudfront when users login. The data is tracked by putting metadata into a Dynamo
				table.
				The application was written in React.

				<h3><u>Project B:</u></h3> I helped an IT security company to fully uplift all their infrastructure
				into
				an up to date, considered and designed three tier VPC.<br>NAT Gateways, Application load balancers
				with
				AWS Cognito + MFA. Uplifted all their current applications. Setup instance profiles, Systems
				Manager,
				and cloudwatch agents. New applications were rolled out to new infrastructure, and major version
				updates
				for Gitlab, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Wazuh, Greenbone Security Manager, Nessus, and Gophish.
